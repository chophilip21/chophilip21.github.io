# 1.0 Networking Top Down Approach

In the [previous post](https://chophilip21.github.io/openssh_part2/), I learned about the basics of networking, and discovered that there are insane amount of contents related to it, which I must know as a professional software engineer. At universities, it takes at least two semesters two fully cover all the essential topics related to networking, something that I lack as I did not study computer science for my undergraduate studies. I really wanted to fill up this gap of knowledge, and my colleague recommended ["Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach"](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/online_lectures.htm) by James F.Kurose and Keith W.Ross. I will be summarizing the core ideas that are relevant to me, and adding my thoughts to it in the next few blog posts.
