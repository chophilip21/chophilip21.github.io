# Studying Algorithms with Python

If you are software engineer, there is no question to the fact that you need to study data structures and algorithms to become a professional. I have stepped my foot into the computer science field from the machine learning side, but this doesn't mean that I can get away without knowing them. This is just like how athletes go for a run every day. They may not be a marathon runners, but stamina is the basis of any sports, just like algorithms. 

<b>Why Python?</b>

Setting aside the fact that I am most comfortable writing codes in Python, Python is one of the most powerful, yet accessible, programming languages in existence, and it's very good for implementing algorithms. The language has a simple, clean syntax that will look similar to the pseudocode used in algorithms, which are not language-specific. The big advantage here is that the user can focus more on understanding and solving the algorithm versus spending a lot of time on memorizing the syntax of the languages being used.
