<b>[Skylab Technologies](https://skylabtech.ai/) (September 2022 - Present)</b>


Skylab Technologies is a AI based company in Vancouver specialized in instant photo retouching, color correction, glare removal, and etc. 

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Skylab, I worked on data engineering project to redesign the company's relational database that holds colossal pool of ML training data. I have:
-  Define new database design using Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
-  Extract and clean scattered local data and upload data to cloud storage
-  Link files to newly defined relational database
