    "Let me tell you a bit about myself. My journey into tech wasn‚Äôt a straight path. After graduating from the Sauder School of Business at UBC in 2016, I began my career as a marketing specialist at a SaaS company. " + 
    "It was a great start ‚Äî but over time, I discovered myself drawn to something more technical, finding solving technical problems extremely rewarding."+ 
    " Back then, AI and machine learning weren‚Äôt nearly as mainstream as they are today, just starting to bloom. But that futuristic edge ‚Äî the idea that machines could perceive, reason, and improve ‚Äî completely fascinated me."+ 
    " Eventually, I decided to follow that spark, leaving my marketing role to pursue a new direction in computer science and machine learning. It was a bumpy road, but in 2021, I successfully completed my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU), specializing in Visual Computing. <br><br>" +
    "Since then, I‚Äôve been working in the machine learning industry, focusing on computer vision. I‚Äôm passionate about researching ML algorithms, and building ML-powered applications that bridge research and reality ‚Äî solving real-world problems with data, algorithms, and a bit of creativity. <br><br>" +
    "If you are interested in learning more about me or my past work, checkout my resume from above and feel free to get in touch with me.",
