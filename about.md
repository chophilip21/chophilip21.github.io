<i>Hello there, Welcome to my website! </i> 

My name is Philip Cho and I am a Machine Learning Engineer and also a software engineer specialized in Computer Vision (CV), experienced in formulating, training, testing and integrating various CV algorithms to the cloud based AI pipeline. 

I was originally born in South Korea, and I grew up in both Japan and Vancouver. Our family immigrated to Vancouver in 2006, and I have been living in Vancouver ever since. I am interested in many different fields, and thus in terms of my career, I have been following a bit of non-convential path unlike many of my friends. I completed Visual Computing Master's Degree at SFU, but prior to that, I completed Bachelor of Commerce degree at Sauder School of Business. I believe I have a unique skill set that combines a businessman acumen and the knowledge of a developer, possessing multiple years of work experience in both fields. I have prepared this website so that you get a general idea of who I am as a person, and also you get to see what I am interested in learning through the blog posts I create everytime I study a new topic related to computer science. 

If you have any question about me, or if you would like to discuss something, please email me at [chophilip21@gmail.com](chohilip21@gmail.com)!
