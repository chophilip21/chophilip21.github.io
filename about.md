<i> Welcome! This section is a brief overview of my background and my goals. </i> 

I was originally born in South Korea and I spent most of my early childhood days in Seoul. I loved playing with computers even as a kid. The very first computer I had at home used dial-up modems that literally borrowed telephone lines for internet connections. Internet was abysmally slow (only about 14/kbps, for christ sake!) and also very expensive. But in late 90's and early 2000's, the Renaissance of internet era finally took off. As cheap, high speed internet started to spread across the nation, PC based games became increasingly popular especially among kids. Masterpiece games like Starcraft, Diablo II, and Nexus (Korean MMORPG), played a large role in developing my early character. 

Time passed and our family immigrated to Vancouver, and I became old enough to go to a college. I had a belief that my career would be bound to the directions that I set at this point, perhaps because of my father who studied electronics at university, remained in that field until he retired. I was making simple games and websites for fun at the time, but I was not confident enough that I could turn this into a caeer. I ended up specializing in business at UBC, which seemed to have better potential as a career. Throughout my Bachelor days at UBC, I met a lot of interesting people, picked up valuable business skills, and spent great time during exchange program to Beijing, China. However, I always felt that I was wearing shoes that did not fit, and that feeling intensified when I started working after graduation. 

A year after working in a business role, it became quite evident that this path was not meant for me. I concluded that it's time to pick up my passion again, and started taking part-time programming courses at BCIT after work. Eventually, I decided to quit my job and join a team of friends to develop mobile application. When we finished building our workstation at a friend's basement, we pictured ourselves to be Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976. But the reality was quite different. The progress was very slow, and I discovered how much I lacked as a programmer. 

Amid debating with myself if I should return to BCIT, I came across a new opportunity unexpectedly. One day, I was assigned a branch that used machine learning algorithm to cluster user types. I was very confused at first, but while working on this feature, I was dumbfounded by the new world of ML and its possibilities. My interest for ML grew larger everyday, and after some research, I found out that SFU launched a Master's Program for deep learning and computer vision, specifically designed for professionals looking for career change. I immediately knew that this was what I had been looking for, and that decision to apply for the program, is probably one of the best decisions I made in my life. It wasn't all smooth sailing though. There was a lot of challenges catching up with the pace of lectures and understanding the materials, and I had many doubts with my own capabilities. However, after my first co-op, I finally started to have conviction in my own skills, and that at long last, I was able to hit that sweet spot between my abilities and passion. 

It's been years now since I have been in this industry, but I never want to stop growing, and that's the reason why I am starting this website and my blogs.
