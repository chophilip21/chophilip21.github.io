<i> Hello there! My name is Philip, and thanks a lot for spending some time to visit my website. I created this section so that you can better picture myself as a person. </i> 

I was born in South Korea and I spent most of my early childhood days in Seoul. I have always been closely tied to computers, as late 90's and early 2000's were truly the Renaissance of internet. The very first computer I had at home used dial-up modems that literally borrowed telephone lines for internet connections. Internet was abysmally slow (only about 14/kbps, for christ sake!) and also very expensive. Internet based games were simply unimaginable. Thankfully, cheap, high speed internet started to spread across the nation, and it became increasingly common for every household to own a PC. I still remember getting completely mesmerized by masterpiece PC games like Starcraft, Diablo II, and Nexus (Korean MMORPG), playing for hours and hours until getting scolded by parents, daydreaming about games at school.               

Time passed and our family immigrated to Vancouver, and I became old enough to go to college. I had a belief that my career would be completely bound to the directions that I set at this point, perhaps because of my father who studied electronics at university, remained in that field until he retired. I was making simple games and websites for fun at the time, but I was not confident enough that I could turn this hobby into a caeer. Thus instead of choosing what I liked, I ended up specializing in business at UBC, which seemed to have better potential as a career. Was it a waste? Not entirely. I do have mixed feelings about the five years I spent at Sauder School of Business. I met a lot of interesting people, picked up valuable business skills, and spent great time during exchange program to Beijing, China. However, I always felt that I was wearing shoes that did not fit, and that feeling intensified when I started working after graduation. 

My first full-time job was a marketing role at a SaaS company, and they offered education fund to all employees every year. I was already programming as a hobby, but I never had a formal exposure to computer science until this point. I signed up for part-time programming courses at BCIT, and a year later, I decided to quit my job and join a team of my friends to develop mobile application. When we finished building our workstation at a friend's basement, we pictured ourselves to be Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976. But the reality was different. The progress was very slow, and I came to a painful discovery of how much I lacked as a programmer, and realized I needed more education. I was debating with myself if I should return to BCIT, but new opportunity came to me in an unexpected fashion. I was working on a branch that used machine learning algorithm to cluster user types for a while, and became dumbfounded by the new world of ML and its possibilities. And there I came across the news that SFU launched a Master's Program for deep learning and computer vision, specifically designed for professionals looking for career change. A few months after applying for the program, I finally received the news that I got accepted into the program.
