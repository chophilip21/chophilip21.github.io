## Thanks for visiting the website!

## Background

I was originally born in South Korea, and I grew up in both Japan and Vancouver. Our family immigrated to Vancouver in 2006, and I have been living in Vancouver ever since. I am interested in many different fields, and thus in terms of my career, I have been following a bit of non-convential path unlike many of my friends. I completed Visual Computing Masterâ€™s Degree at SFU, but prior to that, I completed Bachelor of Commerce degree at Sauder School of Business. I believe I have a unique skill set that combines a businessman acumen and the knowledge of a developer, possessing multiple years of work experience in both fields. I have prepared this website so that you get a general idea of who I am as a person, and also you get to see what I am interested in learning through the blog posts I create everytime I study a new topic related to computer science.
