# About me

## Background

I was originally born in South Korea, and I grew up in both Japan and Vancouver. Our family immigrated to Vancouver in 2006, and I have been living in Vancouver ever since. I am interested in many different fields, and thus in terms of my career, I have been following a bit of non-convential path unlike many of my friends. I completed Visual Computing Masterâ€™s Degree at SFU, but prior to that, I completed Bachelor of Commerce degree at Sauder School of Business. I believe I have a unique skill set that combines a businessman acumen and the knowledge of a developer, possessing multiple years of work experience in both fields. I have prepared this website so that you get a general idea of who I am as a person, and also you get to see what I am interested in learning through the blog posts I create everytime I study a new topic related to computer science.

# Resume

Below is the simplified resume that outlines all my experiences and education related to Computer Science. 

## Work Experience

### Machine Learning Engineer 
<hr>
<b>[Skylab Technologies](https://skylabtech.ai/) (September 2022 - Present)</b>


Skylab Technologies is a AI based company in Vancouver specialized in instant photo retouching, color correction, glare removal, and etc. 

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Skylab, I worked on data engineering project to redesign the company's relational database that holds colossal pool of ML training data. I have:
-  Define new database design using Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
-  Extract and clean scattered local data and upload data to cloud storage
-  Link files to newly defined relational database
-  Create a scheduling scripts to periodically look for new stream of data and upload it to cloud storage and database
-  Generate export script on the company's core library to enable easy export of data by internal staffs


### Computer Vision Software Engineer
<hr>
<b>[Onecup AI](https://www.onecup.ai/) (September 2021 - Aug 2022)</b>


Onecup AI is a AI based company in Vancouver that applies object detection, tracking, and various CV algorithms to monitor livestock (cow, sheep, pigs)

As a Computer vision engineer at Onecup, deep learning pipeline modeling and research work involving:
- Created a Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model based on Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) that accurately reads the tags on a cattle to identify detected instance
- Constructed Face-ID model using progressive CNN that recognizes cows based on extracted facial bounding box of a cow. Cross checked the results with the OCR model in order to ensure top accuracy
- Trained beta deep learning models to be deployed to prototype using Nvidia TAO library and AWS Rekognition
- Contributed to Canadian Angus Association (CAA)'s phenotype scoring system by presenting a novel approach that uses numerical, ratio based calculations to diagnose the condtions of cows' hooves, udders, and etc

## Education

### Master's degree, Computing Science, Visual Computing
<hr>
<b>[Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/graduate-students/academic-programs/professional-master-of-science-in-computer-science/about-the-program/visual-computing.html) (September 2019 - September 2021)</b>

The Master of Visual Computing at SFU trains visual data scientists and engineers who apply specialized knowledge in computer science to develop cutting-edge tools, stimulate product innovation, and explore new technology fronts in all commercial, engineering, and creative professions.

Completed SFU's Computer Science Master's Degree in Visual Computing in September, 2021. Studied various different areas of modern Visual Computing, such as deep learning based computer vision, 3D modeling, AR, VR, and etc.

### Bachelor of Commerce (BCom), Marketing and International Business (IB)
