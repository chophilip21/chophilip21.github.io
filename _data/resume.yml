      Onecup AI is a AI based company in Vancouver that applies object detection, tracking, and various CV algorithms to monitor livestock (cow, sheep, pigs). At Onecup AI, I have worked on deep learning pipeline modeling and research work involving:
    highlights:
      - Created a Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model based on Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) that accurately reads the tags on a cattle to identify detected instance
      - Constructed Face-ID model using progressive CNN that recognizes cows based on extracted facial bounding box of a cow. Cross checked the results with the OCR model in order to ensure top accuracy
      - Trained beta deep learning models to be deployed to prototype using Nvidia TAO library and AWS Rekognition
      - Contributed to Canadian Angus Association (CAA)'s phenotype scoring system by presenting a novel approach that uses numerical, ratio based calculations to diagnose the condtions of cows' hooves, udders, and etc
